# AI Design Certification
A human-assisted AI design certification for Healthcare

We certify outputs: discrete, versioned, viewable… screens, flows, diagrams, data viz. We’re not cert’ing that ’this AI is good’ but that ’this specific artifact is fit for purpose under these conditions.’

What passes and fails = safety, data integrity, regulatory fit, usability, how the flow works together, likelihood of X being operational, language, bias, etc.
= the certifiable surface layer
